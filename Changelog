Tue Feb 12 2008 Vladimir Shabanov # 0.3.1
	* Thanks to Anders Backman osgCal now have CMake build system.
	* Major restructuring of osgCal internal classes
	* Added possiblity to tune each mesh's parameters
	* Moved from VBOs to Display lists for geometry (glCallList is
	  faster for multiple meshes, than VBO setup)
	* Reduced memory footprint

Wed Aug 22 2007 Vladimir Shabanov # 0.3.0
	* Ported to OSG 2.0.0 and Cal3d 0.11.0 (not backward compatible
	  with 0.10.0 due to some changes in animation mixer?)
	* Bug fixes
	* Some experiments in shaders

Fri May 4 2007 Vladimir Shabanov # 0.3.0 preliminary
	* Ported to OSG 1.9.1
	* Added GLSL skinning
	* Added support for normal mapped, transparent and two-sided
	  materials
	* Improved mesh deformation calculation
	* Many small optimizations

Wed Jun 1 2005 Ruben Lopez
	* Ported to OSG 0.9.9
	* Modified documentation and created Doxyfile
	* Merged with Jan Ciger changes

Wed Mar 16 2005 Ruben Lopez & Jose A. Iglesias # 0.1.5
	* Ported to the new version of the Cal3d API (Cal3d 0.10.0)
	* Fixed the problem with flip textures
	* Fixed initial time values for the animations
	* Fixed problem with the new empty constructor of Model class
	* New method to load animations and associate one name to save
          and recover them later.
        * New code for read/write animations with its name associated.
	* Fixed the problem of locate textures in the correct path, now
          the .osg model can find them.

Sun Nov 02 Ruben Lopez
	* Now the loader can find cal3d files with paths relative to the
	  .osg file.

Sun Apr 20 Ruben Lopez
	* Fixed 'bug?' with Materials, it seems that with textures
          activated, the materials should be deactivated with
          glColorMaterial :-m

Sun Apr 20 Alberto Farre # 0.1.2
	* Ported to windows
	* Example enhaced to cicle through animations with 'm' key
	* Visual studio projects now use osgProducer instead of osgGLUT

Sat Apr 19 Rubén López # 0.1.1
	* Ported to osgProducer instead of osgGLUT
        * Cleaned up the example
